<li>Filling the frame with soil (we use a premium 50 - 50 organic topsoil/composted manure mix)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Finding out which vegetables you love the best, and researching the best varieties and methods for growing them.</li>
<li>Designing a garden layout and schedule that will yield the best results for both your harvest and the overall health and sustainability of your garden.</li>
</ul>
